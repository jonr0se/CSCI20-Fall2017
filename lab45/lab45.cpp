/*
The purpose of this lab is to create user names for a website. It should take a user input first name up to 10 characters.
It should also take a user input last name up to 20 characters. It should tell the user if the name is larger than the max size.
It should also determine if the names are the same and output a warning. It should create three different user name options.
(for example: apbrowne; aprilbrowne; abrowne).
